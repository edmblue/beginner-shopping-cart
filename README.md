Hi!

My name is Raquel Betancourt

This is my first repository, I'm trying to be my best version, trying to build my future, my passions, my dreams

This project is the first step

It was really fun to learn and do

Getting to know new methods as .map and .filter, and understanding the logic of doing every step 

<b>this was done with a html and css template... I just focused in the Javascript code<b>
